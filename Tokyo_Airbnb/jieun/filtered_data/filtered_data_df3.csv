1306664,35.70263,139.74147,4.91,4.9,4.9,4.93,4.9,4.91,4.74,Oh this is a really fantastic place for my family to have a vocation in Tokyo It is located in a traditional Japanese neighborhood and surrounded by good restaurants and bars so you will never feel lonely when you come back to the place after daytime tour  Compared with hotels this place make you feel more close to local people and easier to taste the Japanese culture  The host is a real gentleman and easy going He let me feel easy when my kid brought some troubles to the beddings  So thanks to Mas and hope to visit this place once more in the next trip to Tokyo
1306664,35.70263,139.74147,4.91,4.9,4.9,4.93,4.9,4.91,4.74,This small but perfectlyformed room is exactly what ones needs in Tokyo  Convenient stylish comfortable and in a great neighbourhood Restaurents of all descriptions within walking distance  Mas is a very considerate and efficient host  Although just above a restaurant we had no noise at all  Only thing to be aware of is cars cant drive up the small street so you need to wheel your suitcase a short distance and carry it up two flights  All round a very suitably cool Tokyo pad
1306664,35.70263,139.74147,4.91,4.9,4.9,4.93,4.9,4.91,4.74,You cant get a better Airbnb experience than this Nice and cozy neighbourhood spacious room  mordern and fancy design comfortable bed clean toilets  with nice shampoo and soft towels and most importantly a super nice host Mas was very responsive and a semi tour guide for our  3 nights stay in Tokyo He provided me very detailed information on dinning and restaurants he can even book restaurants for you in advance considering its actually hard to communicate in Japan because of the language Mas does it all for you If you are a foodie like me you will absolutely love the neighborhood so many nice restaurants and also easy to travel to shopping areas such as harajuku and shinjuku The only downside to the room is the stairs if you have a large suitcase like me itll take a bit strength to take it down with all the shoppings inside But I guess its not a big issue considering all the other benefits 5 stars experience overall
1306664,35.70263,139.74147,4.91,4.9,4.9,4.93,4.9,4.91,4.74,My 10 year old son and I had a wonderful time staying in Mas Suzukis apartment for 3 nights The description of his apartment is spot on clean well decorated and with everything one traveller needs The location of the place is perfect as to the main attractions subway restaurants and the like All within walking distance or easily reachable Mas Suziki is unbelievable friendly and a wonderful host When we arrived he explained how everything worked Furthermore he was very helpful so that we did not have any problem to getting around In addition he was very responsive both to our concerns and to requests for information He offered an extra umbrella when it rained all day  In sum we felt privileged to staying in his apartment and cannot wait to come back in the near future

1526132,35.69857,139.704,4.84,4.82,4.78,4.92,4.94,4.81,4.75,Min was a fantastic host and has a skill bringing people together I stayed for several days at his guesthouse and met a dozen interesting and lovely people The place is clean and the view gorgeous Especially the rooftop is an eyecandy  The area is convenient and interesting as well Whenever I get back to Tokyo this will be the place to stay

1526132,35.69857,139.704,4.84,4.82,4.78,4.92,4.94,4.81,4.75,I like to separate my review into categories so here goesA About the apartment1 The location is very convenient Just 200 meters from the HigashiShinjuku subway station 2 The rooms are reasonably sized and good enough for 23 people3 There are some excellent places to eat in a 200 meters radius like an amazing sushi place very good curry soup joint a Hokkaido speciality and a very good japanese style barbecue placeB About the host Ming1 Very nice and helpful2 Tries to accommodate requests3 He gave us a special discount as my friend was leaving early and so that I dont have to pay for the entire room for 1 day4 The room we got initially was quite small for 2 people and so he shifted us to another room as soon as it was available5 He will also be happy to take you around and tries to keep guests informed about events around the areaThings to be careful about1 Tokyo is very hot Try to make sure that during summers you do NOT get a room on the top floor pent house2 The things that upset me most was the inadequate number of bathrooms and toilets There was just 1 bathroom between 9 people and 2 toilets 3 Because of the high number of people using these spaces sometimes they are not clean especially the bathroomOverall the place is good if you are on a tight budget The location is very convenient I give this place 38 stars I had to give 4
1526132,35.69857,139.704,4.84,4.82,4.78,4.92,4.94,4.81,4.75,Min is a very nice and friendly guy His appartment is very clean and very nice place especially the location just 510mins walk to the Shinjuku stationIt is just a pity that we only stayed in there for 1 night Next time to Tokyo I must go back again and stay longer

1526132,35.69857,139.704,4.84,4.82,4.78,4.92,4.94,4.81,4.75,Mins place is an example of people who take their Airbnb hosting seriously Occupying the top 3 floors of a very conveniently located building in Shinjuku the large expanse of glass windows gives the place an open feel and a a nice view of the city streets  Min lives elsewhere but comes in to clean every morning and to meet new arrivals  Hes a great guy friendly personable and with excellent command of English and I would assume Japanese and Korean though I didnt try those  The unit is well stocked with guest essentials and more towels than one could easily count the wifi connection is great and the inroom AC was strong and a welcome retreat from the hot Tokyo summer  Im glad I stayed there and would do so again next time I visit the city 
1526132,35.69857,139.704,4.84,4.82,4.78,4.92,4.94,4.81,4.75,Mins the best Was more than accommodating Gave specific directions from Narita and even met us at ShinOkubo Station to help us back to the sharehouse Showed us the area and we had a great time Everyone else staying there was super cool too and we made lots of friends Not only was it my first time in Japan it was my first time out of country and I couldnt have felt more at home Theres a lot to do in the area and it is extremely easy to get around to any of the major areas in Tokyo This place was so much fun Im actually only on the airbnb website right now to book it again Highly recommend 
1526132,35.69857,139.704,4.84,4.82,4.78,4.92,4.94,4.81,4.75,I would like to say with all the positive reviews about this host is ALL TRUE because it was a fantastic experience It was my first time visiting Japan and also my first time visiting japan by myself Min provided me with FULL directions and CLEAR instructions on how to get to the Shinjuku share house by public transport from the central of Tokyo which was clear and simple one route takes about 10 mins from central Shinjuku by train As i was not great with directions and it being my first time Min had kept in contact with me all the way and made sure i found my way to the right area As i walked into the apartment complex i was greeted by the lovely Min which not long after a nice introduction i felt very comfortable After a quick rest Min then showed me around the complex where everything was bathrooms toilets etc then showed me to the rooms i was staying in Shared a room for  3 nights  then a private room for 4 nights which was all clear and simple  Nothing much to it at all  The location is very close to anything and everything in Shinjuku and everything is a walkable distance  you could walk for about 15 mins and end up in the next city it was amazing Train stations were very close too one which is about 510 min walk and another in central Shinjuku which will take no longer than 15 mins walk but time flies when youre observing the area and exploring that you would not even notice the time You will never get bored with this city Over the 7 nights in total i have stayed at the Shinjuku Share house i felt at the end it was like my second home Min was very friendly and he took a couple of us for a night out just to get to know us as he likes to discover different cultures around the world Min is very good at taking care of his guests including myself  always a guy that is has a happy HELLO in the morning which was pleasing The Shinjuku share house is well maintained Min comes in every morning to clean  as reviews have stated on here but will not intrude in your personal area The cleaning is done in the main kitchen bathroom and toilet area Overall i could not ask for a better host It is a great way for solo travelers that come to Japan to get to know other internationals travelling and maybe happy to share their Japan experiences together as i have I came to Japan by myself not knowing anyone and had left Japan back home with a bunch of great friends i met from around the world including Min I will definitely come back soon and stay here again Thanks again Min

1574946,35.69848,139.70433,4.82,4.82,4.84,4.96,4.97,4.88,4.77,Travel to Tokyo has twice lived in Mins house my family and I are very fond of here Min is a good friendly people large windows of the room you can see the street is a rare good place another from the subway close nearby supermarket there are many life is very convenient function Next time you go to Tokyo or will choose Mins house We highly recommend  
1574946,35.69848,139.70433,4.82,4.82,4.84,4.96,4.97,4.88,4.77,I stayed in four different locations during my stay in Tokyo unfortunately I waited until the last minute to book accommodation and Mins Shinjuku Sharehouse is easily my favorite  Min is a really warm and hospitable host  While his reservation confirmation provides detailed directions useful on the intricate streets of Tokyo when I returned to the city after a brief stay in Kyoto he was gracious enough to meet me at the station and guide me to the apartment  For rainy days he has extra umbrellas for guests to use on the day I left he generously gave me one of them  Apparently he and the other guests go out on Friday nights which sounds like tons of fun although I missed out because I was staying less than a week and had to leave the previous dayAs indicated by the name the apartment is located in Shinjuku which is one of the central hubs of Tokyo  Using the metro system its easy to get to other parts of the city without having to do dozens of transfers The surrounding neighborhood is packed with Korean restaurants though you can easily find other cuisinesThe apartment has a nice little common room in the kitchen area with a couch and sound system  Like all the rooms theres a balcony that looks out onto a great view of Shinjuku  At night especially you can feel the pulse of the city    I stayed in the single room which allows for some privacy  My advice would be to make a reservation request ASAP as the rooms book out quickly
1574946,35.69848,139.70433,4.82,4.82,4.84,4.96,4.97,4.88,4.77,Staying at Mins place was a pleasure  He took me out in Shinjuku and introduced me to others staying at the sharehouse  The location was exellent  30 minutes from anywhere you would want to go in Tokyo
1574946,35.69848,139.70433,4.82,4.82,4.84,4.96,4.97,4.88,4.77,Min is the best host and the coolest guy i met in Tokyo Always helping and perfect instructions for a stay without problems Also great view from the guesthouse lots of nice guests and perfectly central location close to shinjuku station I recommend

1574946,35.69848,139.70433,4.82,4.82,4.84,4.96,4.97,4.88,4.77,Min was such a great host He was waiting when I arrived and made sure to send clear directions in advanced  The sharehouse is located in Shinjuku within walking distance of plenty of nightlife but the residence itself was calm and quiet I was in a private room and the other rooms in this apartment I think were all either private or shared for two people so it was easy to get to know and meet other people but also have your own space if needed I was traveling solo and it was a great for my needshighly recommend and would love to stay again the next time Im in Tokyo
