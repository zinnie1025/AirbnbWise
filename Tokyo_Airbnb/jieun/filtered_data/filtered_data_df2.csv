197677,35.71707,139.82608,4.78,4.74,4.92,4.84,4.83,4.53,4.79,Great place to stay  quiet neighborhood and not far from the subway Allot of convenient shops walking distance including a major supermarket   It was great being able to shop and cook our food as the place had everything you need to do so The subway system in Tokyo also made this place great as everything was just a train ride away once you figure out the map I would defiantly recommend this place to anyone who is lucky enough to be browsing this  
197677,35.71707,139.82608,4.78,4.74,4.92,4.84,4.83,4.53,4.79,Great appartment reasonably close to transportation The appartment is beautifully presented and spacious The bathroom was a joy to soak in after a day of sightseeing and the nearby supermarket was an amazing experience When we return will certainly stay here again
197677,35.71707,139.82608,4.78,4.74,4.92,4.84,4.83,4.53,4.79,My friend Kara and I stayed in Yoshimi and Mareks holiday apartment in April 2012 The apartement was quite difficult to find even though we had written down directions from google maps and asked several people for help In the end someone from a store was able to find the place on a map and actually walked us to it so we knew where it was The instructions about finding the key for the door were also not specific enough so we looked around for a long time before we found them We also called Yoshimi and Marek on the phone number they had provided us with incase we needed assistance because we could not find the key and they did not answer or return this call at any time during our stay Apart from this the apartment was very nice It was clean had clear instructions a tourist folder with lots of useful information and wifi We enjoyed our stay and liked it mostly because it was so close to the Sky Tree which was great to seeKittie and Kara

197677,35.71707,139.82608,4.78,4.74,4.92,4.84,4.83,4.53,4.79,Notre séjours à Oshiage a été excellent Beaucoup de difficultés pour trouver lappartement mais heureusement Marek nous a laissé son numéro de téléphone et est même venue nous chercherA part ça lappartement est juste ce quil faut pour 4 personnes maximum Dormir sur les futons fut une révélation quel bien fou ça fait Lappartement est propre est tout est mis à disposition machine à laver séchelinge four réfrigérateur douche avec savon et shampoing climatiseur internetDe plus je trouve que lappartement est bien situé ok il est assez éloigné de Tokyo la grande ville mais on trouve de tout à proximité de lappart avec 2 Lawson à quelques mètres des petits resto la gare et son SkyTreeEn bref le Oshiage Holiday Apartment est un très bon choix pour ceux qui ne veulent pas payer une fortune pour se loger à Tokyo  Le truc cest quil faut prendre ses marques dans le métro et ça roule Le quartier est très sûr même tard le soir donc on peut en profiter au maximum

197677,35.71707,139.82608,4.78,4.74,4.92,4.84,4.83,4.53,4.79,The apartment was in a very good location Oshiage station now has the Skytree and Tokyo Solamachi and is a very exciting place of activity There are many shops restaurants and a very nice grocery store with great box sushi The walk to the station is very short and easy since the Skytree is always in view It was very easy to get to the apartment from the airport In the day the apartment also has very nice and comforting lighting The heaters and other amenities were very nice The hosts provided a very informative packet of information that helped us on our trip 
197677,35.71707,139.82608,4.78,4.74,4.92,4.84,4.83,4.53,4.79,The apartment is exactly as described and was clean quiet and convenient to Oshiage metro railway station Tokyo skytree and to the sights and attractions of downtown Tokyo  We are a family of four 2 adults and 2 teenage children and we were comfortable as the apartment came fully equipped  We enjoyed our stay and found everything necessary on hand  Shops are conventiently located at Oshiage station or at nearby Hikifune where a good food court and supermarketgrocery store is located

197677,35.71707,139.82608,4.78,4.74,4.92,4.84,4.83,4.53,4.79,If youre an independent andor adventurous traveller and I assume you are if you are an Airbnb user the Oshiage Holiday Apartment is a delight We stayed there in February 2013 with our children and loved the exposure to what I assume is a typical Tokyo apartment One thing we discovered is how efficiently kitchen space the bedroom and bathrooms are set up  youll need to read the house manual to understand various appliances and procedures but once you do its easy to manage We also liked the neighborhood which is a warren of small streets and shops about a 15 minute walk from Tokyo Skytree Its very quiet  past 10 pm or so you wont hear much noise with the exception of a bicycle going past or the neighborhood watchman making the rounds with his clacker Take some time to walk around and see the sights sounds and tastes of the neighborhood before succumbing to the shops and restaurants in the Skytree mall   
197677,35.71707,139.82608,4.78,4.74,4.92,4.84,4.83,4.53,4.79,Marek  Yashimis place was just right for our family We did not get to spend much time in it since we found ourselves out exploring Tokyo from morning to night during our week there I dont think we even used the TV once but it is a nice TVWhen we arrived in Tokyo we took the limo bus from Narita to TCAT about 2900 yen per person with discount for people aged 25 and under and then a taxi from TCAT to the apartment  cost about 2500 yen It would probably have been easier and cheaper to take the train but as we had a ton of luggage we did not want to deal with stairs crowds long walks etc Unfortunately the taxi driver could not find the apartment But he got us close enough that we were able to find it easily on footWe had no trouble finding the key to the apartment based on instructions from Marek  Yashimi Toiletries soap shampoo coffee tea  cooking supplies were kindly provided The recycling rules did get a little confusing for us and we hope that we did it correctlyTheres a washing machine in the kitchen area with detergent kindly provided You can hang your laundry in the bathroom and turn on the air to dry the clothes The kitchen is nice It has a refrigerator freezer microwave did not use toaster oven did not use stove with a fish grill electric kettle used a lot and a coffeemaker did not use And yes there are pots and pans as well as dishes and cutleryFrom the apartment it is a pretty easy walk to the OshiageSkytree station However after a long day of walking the walk from the station back to the apartment always seemed three times as long  The subway can be confusing but when we needed help we would stop by the ticket office or window for help One night we were so tired we just took a taxi from the station to the apartment Even with his GPS on the driver got lost for a little bit Took longer than it should but we got to the apartment fineOn the day we left one of us tried to get a taxi to go to the apartment to pick up the rest of the family and our bags However the taxi driver said he could not go down that alleyway that he would wait up on the road by the yellow building Fortunately it wasnt that far a walk I recommend this place to anyone who wants to stay in a real Tokyo apartment at a great cost The location itself is far enough away from the touristy places like Ginza that you can easily find more affordable restaurants or food from takeout places and supermarkets close byThank you guys for letting us stay in your lovely place We hope to be back someday

905944,35.67878,139.67847,4.76,4.78,4.75,4.87,4.9,4.77,4.77,My partner and I stayed at Alfreds place for 7 nights and we absolutely loved it Living in America it took us about a day to adjust to the space It is somewhat small but big for Tokyo standards and having two bedrooms is a luxury in Tokyo The location is very practical Two stations away from Shinjuku station it is very easy to get around town from there You can also walk it in about 30 mn which is nothing when you start to realize how tentacular Tokyo is The place is very clean and has a washingmachine Just follow the instructions that Alfred leaves in this very wellexplained folder and you will be fine There is Internet at the apartment which is invaluable when trying to figure out what to do and where to go to next The supermarket is a block away and is open 24h  Very practical There are many restaurants around and of course vending machines everywhere if you need a quick soda or coffee fix If you are a tall person like my partner be careful with the doors thresholds which are quite low but it seems to be a standard here in Japan Alfred was amazing He communicated with us very well and made our stay very comfortable even though he was not there He was very professional and helped us figure out the little quirks of Japanese culture via eMails and AirBnB private messages Overall we enjoyed the place so much that we tried to book it again when we were coming back to Tokyo unfortunately it was already booked and Alfred was very apologetic and overtly nice Book well in advance as Alfreds place is very popular on AirBnB We would most definitely look into staying there again in the future 
905944,35.67878,139.67847,4.76,4.78,4.75,4.87,4.9,4.77,4.77,the apartment was beautiful and as pictured  perfect for 4 people to stay for 3 weeks  The location was close to everything such as the pharmacies 24 hour groceries 711  and subway The 500 yen was a repeat visit  Our time spent here  was made very comfortable by our host  he had brought in an extra air fan and coffee maker for the apartment His exceptional hospitality and advice made our first experience in japan amazingThe phone provided was a life saver

905944,35.67878,139.67847,4.76,4.78,4.75,4.87,4.9,4.77,4.77,My wife adult son and I stayed here for 5 nights  This apartment is exactly as described  2 bedrooms and sofa beds in the living room  Everything was neat and tidy  The apartments location was convenient only two short subway stops away from Shinjuku station  The apartments residential location also provided a respite from the sometimes overwhelming hustle  bustle of Tokyo  The residential area was quiet and peacefulBooking was fast and easy  Alfred provided excellent information on checking in and staying in the apartment Overall it was an excellent 5 nights and we will not hesitate to stay here if the occasion arises
905944,35.67878,139.67847,4.76,4.78,4.75,4.87,4.9,4.77,4.77,Alfred was great  especially accommodating considering our cross continental time difference He made sure our portable wifi was available and charged when we arrived you NEED this  it was seriously a life saver and the instructions were easy for our cab driver to follow from Shinjuku station The place is exactly as described very clean and authentic Japanese We were able to cook in the kitchen and comfortably slept in the master bedroom while using the second bedroom for our luggage There were plenty of extra towels and the tankless water heater ensured two people could shower without issueThe neighborhood Hatagaya is SUPER cute and only 12 stops away from Shinjuku so you can basically get anywhere in the city and periodically stop in to take a break nap etc I think it is important for Americans to remember that everything is not Western sized so be prepared for a smallish bathroom  not quite airplane sized but not much bigger and low ceilings  in my opinion however it made the experience more unique and interesting Do keep in mind the scooters that park below  they are very active during the day and we almost ran into them on foot a few timesOverall great value and location and if I were to travel to Tokyo again I would most definitely recommend this listing

905944,35.67878,139.67847,4.76,4.78,4.75,4.87,4.9,4.77,4.77,Nous avons passé un très bon séjour dans lappartement dAlfred Le quartier est agréable  sans être étouffant comme le coeur de tokyo il est tout de même animé et entouré de commerces bars postes etc sans pour autant être bruyant au contraire  brDe plus et contrairement à beaucoup de logements bnb lappartement dAlfred est bien fourni en ce qui concerne les choses de la vie pratique qui sont pénibles à acheter lorsque lon est juste de passage  économe spatule papier aluminium et le manuel dutilisation est en anglais ce qui est fort heureux pour lutilisation de la machine à laver On mange volontiers à la maison plutôt quau restaurant ce qui permet déconomiserbrCependant il y a quelques points à relever  lappartement peut accueillir 5 personnes mais à quatre nous étions déjà bien à létroit Il ny a que trois chaises pour la table de la salle à manger La chambre principale est étroite pour deux personnes avec deux grosses valises néanmoins supportable pour un couple dautant plus que le lit est grand De manière générale lappartement est parfait pour trois mais à quatre il est vite fatiguant brAutre point pour les personnes limitées sur les sous comme les étudiants  lappartement est à deux stations de shinjuku mais sur une ligne privée de métro ce qui fait rapidement monter le budget transport  brEnfin il faut prendre en compte quà plus de deux voyageurs dans lappartement une taxe de 25 dollars par personne et par nuit est ajoutée ce qui augmente considérablement le prix de lappartement par nuit Alors que comme dit précédemment lappartement est vraiment étroit pour quatre  le montant de cette taxe ne semble donc pas justifiée Pour autant on peut y passer un très agréable séjour et Alfred est très disponible pour toutes questions et conseils ce qui est fort appréciable pour une première fois au japon 
905944,35.67878,139.67847,4.76,4.78,4.75,4.87,4.9,4.77,4.77,Alfred is a nice and friendly person His apartment is cozy perfectly located in the beautiful area of Hatagaya and very close to all major attractions We easily walked to ShinjukuWeve really enjoyed our stay at Alfreds place Everything was in a perfect taste and Japan is an unsurpassed adventure

905944,35.67878,139.67847,4.76,4.78,4.75,4.87,4.9,4.77,4.77,We enjoyed this apartment It felt very authentic charming and comfortable perfect for 34 adults or a family of 4 The neighborhood had its own charm many little side streets to explore with convenient shops restaurants and fruit stands The Hatagaya subway entrance is only a 45 min walk
905944,35.67878,139.67847,4.76,4.78,4.75,4.87,4.9,4.77,4.77,A very good experience  very well situated 2 separates rooms for my husband my 13 years old son and me practical pocket wifi Every thing was perfect We recommend  perfect location to explore Tokyo
905944,35.67878,139.67847,4.76,4.78,4.75,4.87,4.9,4.77,4.77,Near Shinjuku is the perfect starting point to explore Tokyo The description of the appartment and the way to the appartment are very good Its just a few minutes to Hatagaya Station in a calm environment The appartment has two separate bedrooms and is spacious The mobile wifi was very important to find our way in the mega city We didnt meet William but contact by WhatsApp was very fast 
905944,35.67878,139.67847,4.76,4.78,4.75,4.87,4.9,4.77,4.77,William was a very helpful host flexible and gracious The apartment is a very quick walk to a Shinjukubound Metro train and the neighborhood has a good bustle about it without being overwhelming The main concern for me was hitting my head some of the door jambs are a bit short for taller individuals But thats not the worst problem one can have in a foreign country
905944,35.67878,139.67847,4.76,4.78,4.75,4.87,4.9,4.77,4.77,We would stay here again The apartment was great for a family of three Comfortable big beds big sofa and quiet neighbourhood Great little restaurants and shops near the local pedestrian street The portable wifi was perfect for our stay and we found the apartment to be as described 
905944,35.67878,139.67847,4.76,4.78,4.75,4.87,4.9,4.77,4.77,The apartment was just as nice as described The Pocket Wifi was very nice to have so that we could use Google Maps and other tools without incurring data charges The apartment is in a great location very close to a subway station that had easy access to the rest of Tokyo and super easy access to a shopping street filled with an fresh food market  plenty of restaurants  We had an awesome time staying at this place and we felt more like locals by the end of the trip 
905944,35.67878,139.67847,4.76,4.78,4.75,4.87,4.9,4.77,4.77,We never met William but he gave us very good directions to the flat and he was very communicative through whatsapp He also answered all of our questions regarding both train travel and other things The apartment is exactly how in the pictures clean and with a very good aircondition system for warmth in our case Shinjuku station is a twostop ride away from Hatagaya station a mere five minute walk away from the flat The bathroom was clean and due to the water being heated by gas theres always warm water very appreciated since we were three people The flat has more than enough space and the main bed has a superb mattress It even has a little balcony The WiFiwalked is to our mind the invention of the year its fabulous to use when trying to navigate the enormous city that is Tokyo If you plan to use it as much as we did however bring a little powerbank with you to ensure you never run out of juice while in Tokyo  The apartment is also close to a good supermarket look right when you exit the underground other side of the street lots of small restaurants bars and local shops We would especially recommend the Korean BBQ restaurant located near the Hatagaya stationWe enjoyed our stay in every possible way and wed recommend this flat to anyone
905944,35.67878,139.67847,4.76,4.78,4.75,4.87,4.9,4.77,4.77,We loved Williams apartment The location and neighborhood were fantastic It was easy to get to from all over Tokyo There was plenty of space and it was a great place to come home to after sightseeing all day He was helpful and communicative and we had zero issues The pocket wifi was a lifesaver Thanks again William 
905944,35.67878,139.67847,4.76,4.78,4.75,4.87,4.9,4.77,4.77,The location was fantastic and exactly as described  Its just outside some of the major tourist areas Shinjuku Shibuya while still having quite a bit going on in the area itself  A few minor complaints the unit is equipped with a washing machine but the instructions left indicate that there is a potential issue with drainage which require you to remain with the unit while its doing much of the cycle to ensure it drains properly  While we did laundry without any issues this was fairly stressful as there was the potential to flood the unit and downstairs neighbor  So come with enough clothes for your entire trip or be prepared to sit vigilantly while your clothes wash to ensure proper drainage Secondly my motherinlaw initially settled into the bedroom with the smaller bed but complained that the bed was very uncomfortable  She moved to the living room couch and was pleased with how comfortable that was though my wife and I then had limited access to the kitchendining room all attached to the living roomOverall though our stay was pleasant  The nearby streetmarket truly does have everything you could wantneed for your trip including a Michelinrated ramen restaurant  We often would tour the city during the day and return in the evening to eat at the nearby restaurantsshops
905944,35.67878,139.67847,4.76,4.78,4.75,4.87,4.9,4.77,4.77,Great place
905944,35.67878,139.67847,4.76,4.78,4.75,4.87,4.9,4.77,4.77,As a family of three with an 11 year old this apartment was absolutely the right choice for our stay in Tokyo William was on hand via Viber as soon as we arrived  The apartment was absolutely as described really clean with all we needed for a comfortable stay and in an excellent location Highly recommended as the best stay in Tokyo
905944,35.67878,139.67847,4.76,4.78,4.75,4.87,4.9,4.77,4.77,Great apartment  Fast WiFi spacious and great location  Would definitely stay here again in the future
905944,35.67878,139.67847,4.76,4.78,4.75,4.87,4.9,4.77,4.77,The location was ideal Just a few minutes walk from the train station and even less to a lovely main street at the heart of Hatagaya I would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the area
905944,35.67878,139.67847,4.76,4.78,4.75,4.87,4.9,4.77,4.77,Fantastic location very lively but local  street just behind house authentic but close to the actio n of Shibuya and Shinjuku Very comfortable house with super fast wifi nice balcony and great clear instructions making it easy to find highly recommended
905944,35.67878,139.67847,4.76,4.78,4.75,4.87,4.9,4.77,4.77,Very spacious place in a great location  with easy access to the rest of Tokyo although be aware that if you have a JR pass this is not near a JR station so you have to pay 130 yen for a single from Shinjuku The place looks a little different from the photos but still very nice just a few things a bit old a tired The drainage system isnt great and if you want to use the washing machine you have to pretty much be stood next to it The apartment is also in a very noisy block with doors slamming constantly There is also a fleet of scooters below the building which come and go at all hours so it isnt good if youre a light sleeper All in all a good size place in a nice safe neighbourhood
905944,35.67878,139.67847,4.76,4.78,4.75,4.87,4.9,4.77,4.77,The place is nice and it is easy to reach the rest of Tokyo from here The apartment is a bit darker then the photos suggest but that is no problem Three notes though 1 The WiFi is limited to 1GB per day If you reach this limit the WiFi is rate limited for 2 additional days This is absolutely bad for people working remotely and relying on internetskypevideo calls 2 If you want to use the washing machine you need to be near it due to flooding issues of the pipes which if there would be damage due to overflooding you would have to pay for3 The neighborhood can be quite loud during the night and early in the morning so light sleepers might have problems 
905944,35.67878,139.67847,4.76,4.78,4.75,4.87,4.9,4.77,4.77,This was a great apartment to stay at while in Tokyo My fiancé and I were there for a week and the apartment was as described and in great condition A few of the decorations of the pictures were different as well as the frame on the master bed but it was a very comfortable memory foam mattress The kitchen and living room were nice although we never cooked since we ate out all the time Place is close to a lot of restaurants and convenience stores The place is only a few minutes walk from the Metro train station which allowed much ease and convenience for getting around Tokyo The name of the station is Hatagaya which is only 2 stops from Shinjuku station and 4 stops from Shibuya Station The host was very responsive and answered any questions we had The pocket wifi was great for having internet access on the go and at home I will definitely stay here again the next time I visit Japan
905944,35.67878,139.67847,4.76,4.78,4.75,4.87,4.9,4.77,4.77,Very spacieux There is a big living room so rare in TokyoThe aprtment is 5 minutes wark away from the Keio New Line which one can take you to one of main station of Tokyo Shinjuku for 2 stops Just one thing the mattresses are too soft not comfortable for sleeppingNo air cond in bedrooms only in living room so you need to open the door during the night 
905944,35.67878,139.67847,4.76,4.78,4.75,4.87,4.9,4.77,4.77,Everything was as described and as depicted on the pictures Overall a pleasant stay

905944,35.67878,139.67847,4.76,4.78,4.75,4.87,4.9,4.77,4.77,Nice  spacious apartment It was more than enough space for 2 of us We slept on the sofa bed because there is only one aircon unit in the living room Nonetheless the rest of the apartment was still relatively cool and very comfortable We really enjoyed our stay in this Airbnb 
905944,35.67878,139.67847,4.76,4.78,4.75,4.87,4.9,4.77,4.77,Notre hôte à tout fait pour que nous trouvions facilement et que nous nous sentions bien Ses explications et descriptions étaient précises et utiles Lappartement est un peu plus vieillot que ne laissent voir les photos mais ça a son charme et pour le prix cest vraiment une bonne adresse surtout pour une famille Notre fils de 11 ans avait une chambre séparée cétait parfait je recommande vivement
905944,35.67878,139.67847,4.76,4.78,4.75,4.87,4.9,4.77,4.77,Pocket wifi was the best The location was good The apartment had everything we needed A little bit on a small side for 4 people to fit comfortably But fine if one doesnt mind the couch Aircon was only in the living room so bedrooms were a little warm in summer
905944,35.67878,139.67847,4.76,4.78,4.75,4.87,4.9,4.77,4.77,房子整体上还好但是真的能看懂这串字的其他娃儿们呀订房前需三思还是认真看完所有这个房子的所有评价再下决定吧先说好的地方一 距离新宿原宿还是很近的不过从机场啊啥的到这边要转很多次车二 房东十分积极热情三 设施齐全其他的这个房子有3个房间但只有客厅有一个小空调热得一逼你没听错主卧次卧都没有空调你能想象在东京三十八度的酷热之下没有空调是什么样的感受吗这房子在四楼你可是要人肉抗东西上去的yo说得比较隐晦意思到了即可

905944,35.67878,139.67847,4.76,4.78,4.75,4.87,4.9,4.77,4.77,This apartment is a very convenient and practical apartment for a stay in Tokyo As advertised the apartment is fully equipped its conveniently located close to a very useful subway line and there are many places to have a meal or get essential groceries close by Another plus is the size Compared to another Tokyo apartment that was right by the Shibuya station this place had room to move around and be comfortable We also thought there bed was comfortable It is no frills but if a practical and affordable place is what youre looking for this is a great findbrI would recommend that you know exactly how to get to this apartment ahead of time Despite our hosts detailed directions without wifi you will have a hard time finding it He alludes to pictures of the exterior in his directions However We could not access them using the Airbnb app once  we were traveling We took a taxi from the station and even then it took us a long time to find it  and frankly some luck asking a Japanese person who happened to speak English and who had encountered some people with the same predicament a few weeks prior The host graciously makes himself available through email and WhatsApp but without wifi youre still stranded  Make sure you download the pictures ahead of time and youll be fine
905944,35.67878,139.67847,4.76,4.78,4.75,4.87,4.9,4.77,4.77,Small and comfortable but definitely being run as a business This isnt someones home And being charged nearly 30 to check in a couple of hours early was disappointing The neighbourhood it is in is nice though

1298200,35.73987,139.85176,4.93,4.95,4.96,4.97,4.97,4.75,4.89,Everything was perfect Koji Mr T and Nami took very good care of us Way beyond our expectations 
1298200,35.73987,139.85176,4.93,4.95,4.96,4.97,4.97,4.75,4.89,Ill put this bluntly if you are planning a trip to Tokyo you need to stay with Koji Nami and Mr T brIt doesnt need to be Pine House They have multiple apartments in Tateishi at a variety of price points and their higher priced suites are worth the upgrade Regardless you owe it to yourself to stay with them  brKoji Nami and Mr T are gracious and responsible hosts Their accommodations are very clean and well maintained and every detail is accounted for They are easy to reach and very good at maintaining communication They do your laundry They give fresh towels Heck theyre happy to take you out on the town if youre so inclined It was like I landed in Tokyo and immediately had friends brThe location too is nothing short of ideal Tateishi in my opinion is the optimal way to experience Tokyo as a tourist It is a quiet residential neighbourhood right next to a local train station with a grocery store authentic open air market stand up sushi restaurants tiny bars a drug store a coffee shopeverything youd need for an extended stay all nearby The proximity to the train station means youre only a quick ride and a transfer from the crush of people in exciting places like Shinjuku Shibuya and Asakusa And after a busy day of sightseeing or nightlife it is nice to come home to the peace of Tateishi brTo repeat another reviewer My only complaint is that I didnt stay with them my whole time in Tokyo
1298200,35.73987,139.85176,4.93,4.95,4.96,4.97,4.97,4.75,4.89,My stay at Zen House  Pine Room was very pleasant  Like many of those who had the pleasure to stay with Koji Nami and Mr T I felt very well taken care of since the day I arrived  Directions for everything were thorough and easy to follow especially for the ride in from the airport particularly important for a first time traveller in JapanThe unit was as described on airbnb which was clean spotless and spacious  It was obvious that the owners cared for the unit  Koji was flexible and generous given my early arrival and late departure schedulesI was first worried that the location of the unit would be too far from the central busy area but Id have to say  Katsushika is a very tasteful and humble area I am really glad I stayed away from the hustle bustle spots while still be very accessible to it  Train station was a quick 2 minute walk  Portable wifi was provided and was a travelling essential  I could not have survived without itI wish I had gotten to know Koji Nami and Mr T over a meal or beer but my schedule was quite packed as I was only here for 3 days I will definitely visit and checkin at one of their units again in the near future
1298200,35.73987,139.85176,4.93,4.95,4.96,4.97,4.97,4.75,4.89,special thanks to Koji for this wonderful place to stay the room is cozy just the right size for two The place is really convenient short distance to the station lots selection of restaurant and bars open late to hang The host also provided a portable wifi which is a big plus they are very kind to let me dropped off my luggage on my last day til the time i take off to Narita airport I had a good time staying here and would recommend my friends for their future visit
